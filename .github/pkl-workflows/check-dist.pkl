// In TypeScript actions, `dist/` is a special directory. When you reference
// an action with the `uses:` property, `dist/index.js` is the code that will be
// run. For this project, the `dist/index.js` file is transpiled from other
// source files. This workflow ensures the `dist/` directory contains the
// expected transpiled code.
//
// If this workflow is run from a feature branch, it will act as an additional CI
// check and fail if the checked-in `dist/` directory does not match what is
// expected from the build.
